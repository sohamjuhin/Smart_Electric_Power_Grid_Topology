To detect low voltage in a smart electric power grid topology using Python, you would need to interface with the grid's sensors or monitoring devices. The specific code implementation will depend on the type of sensor or monitoring system you are using and how you can access the voltage readings.

Here's a general example of how you could write a Python code snippet to monitor voltage levels in a power grid


In this example, the get_voltage_reading() function simulates voltage readings by generating random values between 100 and 250 volts. You should replace this code with the actual logic to read voltage data from your sensors or monitoring system.

The is_voltage_low() function checks if the voltage is below a defined threshold (150 volts in this example). You can adjust the threshold according to your specific requirements.

The monitor_voltage() function is the main loop that continuously reads the voltage and checks for low voltage conditions. When a low voltage condition is detected, you can perform appropriate actions, such as generating an alert or sending a notification.

Remember to modify the code based on your specific hardware, sensor interfaces, and the protocols you use to access the grid's monitoring devices.
